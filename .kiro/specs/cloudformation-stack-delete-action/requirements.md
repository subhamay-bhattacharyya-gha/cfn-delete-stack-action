# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a GitHub reusable action that accepts a CloudFormation stack name as input and deletes the specified stack while displaying real-time logs in the console. The action will provide visibility into the deletion process and handle various scenarios that may occur during stack deletion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to use a reusable GitHub action to delete CloudFormation stacks, so that I can automate stack cleanup in my CI/CD workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the action is called with a valid stack name THEN the system SHALL initiate CloudFormation stack deletion
2. WHEN the action is executed THEN the system SHALL validate that the stack name input is provided
3. IF the stack name is empty or missing THEN the system SHALL fail with a clear error message
4. WHEN the stack deletion is initiated THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress logs in the console

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time logs during stack deletion, so that I can monitor the progress and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stack deletion begins THEN the system SHALL continuously poll and display CloudFormation events
2. WHEN CloudFormation events are retrieved THEN the system SHALL format and display them with timestamps
3. WHEN the stack deletion completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message
4. WHEN the stack deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display the failure reason and exit with an error code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the action to handle different stack states gracefully, so that my workflows don't fail unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the specified stack does not exist THEN the system SHALL display a warning message and exit successfully
2. WHEN the stack is already in DELETE_IN_PROGRESS state THEN the system SHALL monitor the existing deletion process
3. WHEN the stack has dependent resources THEN the system SHALL display relevant error messages from CloudFormation
4. IF AWS credentials are not properly configured THEN the system SHALL fail with a clear authentication error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure AWS region and other parameters, so that I can use the action across different AWS environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the action is called THEN the system SHALL accept an optional AWS region input parameter
2. IF no region is specified THEN the system SHALL use the default region from AWS configuration
3. WHEN AWS credentials are required THEN the system SHALL use standard AWS credential resolution methods
4. WHEN the action completes THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate exit codes for success and failure scenarios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the action to be reusable across different repositories, so that I can standardize stack deletion processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the action is published THEN it SHALL be available as a reusable GitHub action
2. WHEN other repositories reference the action THEN they SHALL be able to specify the stack name as an input
3. WHEN the action is used in workflows THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with other GitHub Actions
4. WHEN the action runs THEN it SHALL follow GitHub Actions best practices for logging and error handling
